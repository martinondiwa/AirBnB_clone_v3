 RESTful API, or REST API, is a way for applications to communicate with each other using the internet. It's an application programming interface (API) that follows the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. 
How RESTful APIs work 
Use HTTP requests to access data
Support data types like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE
Present data models and functions in a standard format
Use common web technologies like PHP, JavaScript, and Python
Benefits of RESTful APIs 
Scalability: Can expand to meet growing needs
Flexibility: Can be adapted to different platforms and syntax
Efficiency: Uses less bandwidth than other similar technologies
Simplicity: Easy to use and understand
Use cases Mobile app development, Internet of Things (IoT), Microservices architectures, Connecting applications and components, and Automating tasks like invoicing and timesheet communication. 
Examples of REST APIs Amazon S3, Twitter API, Instagram API, and Plaid. 
RESTful API challenges REST endpoint consensus, API versioning, Authentication, and Security issues.
